                Currently, taking up a decision regarding figuring out of when and where to open a is a difficult task.
                It
                takes
                lot of time and effort of a team behind setting up a restaurant.</p>

            <p>
                Our supervised learning algorithm will help us build complex or tricky features using features such as
                Inauguration date, city, type of restaurant, Demographic data in any given area, age, and gender
                distribution,
                development scales), Real estate (front facade of the location, car park availability), Points of
                interest
                including schools,
                banks.</p>
            <p>
                By using a algorithm in machine learning, this will help us predict the annual revenue of a new
                restaurant.
